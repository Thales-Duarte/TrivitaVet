// NOTE:
// This repository uses ESLint v8 with a classic config in `.eslintrc.json`.
// The previous flat-config file imported from `eslint/config`, which only
// works with ESLint v9+. Keeping this file as a no-op prevents ESLint from
// crashing when it tries to load `eslint.config.mjs` automatically.
